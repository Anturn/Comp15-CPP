Purpose: 
              This assignment will implement a binary tree to do an alphabetizer.
              The tree will save all the words given by specific sequence 
              according to their  ASCII character values. Also, there are two 
              different mode. One is the "interactive" mode, in which you can
              manually type in the words and specify the print order;and an 
              "automated" mode, in which it will read a list of words from a 
              file and print those words in a given order.

        StringBST.h:
                General Guide:
                This is the header file for StringBST, it is the place declares 
                all the functions as well as some variables. Most of the 
                functions defined in the assignment sheet are in the public 
                phase because we will use them. However, most "helper 
                functions" I create are in the private phase because they are 
                used to help the original functions and all of the helper 
                functions are operated recursively.

                class. And it has two run mode. One is "interactive" mode, which 
                is the constructor without any parametertake read in user's 
                input. The other one is an constructor with two parameters, 
                containing the filename and the mode, which will read strings 
                in the text file and prints out the sorted strings.

                This is the functions test the case for StringBST.cpp
                It have two instances, one is declared with parameters
                which directly makes up a binary tree.
                The second one is declared without any parameters and

                One case, just running the function run(). And that is the
                "interavtive" mode, which let the user give the mode and 
                the strings
                
                The second case, I cout messages asking the mode name and 
                filename from the user, and the
                run(string filename, string order) will read the strings from

                finds out that the inputs are 2 , it will run the 
                "automated" mode. If the inputs are 0, then it will
                run the "interactive" mode. If the inputs are wrong
                or not obeys the rule, the programm will terminate
                and give the messages about the error

         Data Structures and Algorithms£º
                 For this assignment, we use the idea of binary tree, which is 
                 linked list has two other pointers points to other two 
                 different nodes which also connect to other nodes as well.
                 It is much easier to select and find the target data and 
                 imformation in logN steps, which is better than normal
                 linked list, we can only linearly serach the data we want.
                 
                 Also, another big idea behind the programm is recursion. Which
                 using the function in itself, makes the function much easier
                 to write. One thing should notice is about when the node
                 point to NULL, we should alsways return because that is 
                 always the base case.
                 
                 add(string elemnt):For this function here, there are three 
                 steps: First, if there is nothing in the tree, then just set 
                 the string to the root: Second, if the string is equal to the
                 current string, then just add the time. Third, if the string
                 is smaller than the current one, then it will go left and 
                 if the string is smaller than the current one, it will
                 go right. The string will continue and process this algorithm 
                 until it get to NULL, then it can just become the new node 
                 there.
                 In a word, if equal, plus time; if smaller of bigger, go left 
                 or right; if get to NULL, make a new node
                 
                 remove(string element):For this function here, it will 
                 encounter several situaltions. First, if the string is just
                 a leaf has no child, then we just minus the time by 1 or just 
                 delete the node. Second, If the node has one child on the left 
                 or right,then the node will just minus the time by 1 or 
                 replaced by the child.Third, if the node has two children, it
                 can be replced by either the largest one on its left side or 
                 the smallest one on its right side because the binary tree here
                 obeys a rule that left is smaller and right is larger.  
                 
                 
    
         Test Explaination:
                 There are two seperate functions I need to test.
                 
                 First of all: BSTTesting.cpp for StringBST.cpp
                 First, there are two kinds of ways to initialize an
                 instance of the class.One with parameters and the other
                 without. 
                 I then have two classes "BST1" and "BST2".
                 I initialize "BST1" with the constructor with parameters, then
                 there is an array of strings being put into the binary tree
                 in "BST1".
                 Then I have "BST2", which initially does not
                 have anything. I test "print()", "size()" and "isEmpty", those
                 three functions for the empty binary tree in "BST2".
                 Then I ues "add()" function to add various strings into 
                 the "BST2", then it has a lot of strings in it.Then I can test 
                 all other funtions which operate with the binary trees with
                 several strings.
                 
                 
                 Second: AlphaTesting for Alphabetizer.cpp 
                 There are two different run functions in the class.
                 One is the "run()" whcih does not have any parameters. Then 
                 it just ask for mode and strings from user, then it runs
                 smoothly.
                 
                 The other one is "run(string filename, string order)",
                 then I let the user gives the mode and filename. Then the 
                 programm just runs.
